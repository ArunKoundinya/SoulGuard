## Why SoulGuard?

Suicides are a global crisis, with over 700,000 lives lost annually. Root causes include social isolation, financial distress, relationship struggles, and mental health disorders, with depression as a leading contributor. Depression often leaves individuals feeling hopeless and emotionally overwhelmed, and societal stigma or lack of resources prevents many from seeking help in time.

Depression is a mental health condition marked by persistent sadness, loss of interest, and fatigue. Research including the [seminal studies by Beck and colleagues](https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/foc.4.2.291?download=true), highlights a strong link between depression and suicide, as untreated depression can lead to suicidal ideation due to feelings of hopelessness. Addressing this connection is crucial to preventing tragedies.

Soul Guard addresses this by leveraging AI to analyze social media and user input, detecting depression indicators and differentiating between general symptoms and suicide risks. With its dual-user model—"For You" and "For Whom You Care"—the app provides tailored interventions, emotional tracking, and direct access to resources, empowering users to take proactive steps and save lives.

## How Soul Guard Stands Out?

The global mental health solutions market is expanding rapidly, projected to reach \$10 billion by 2026, driven by rising awareness and demand for innovative tools. This includes apps, teletherapy services, and suicide prevention platforms, highlighting the urgent need for effective solutions, particularly as suicide rates rise among younger populations.
