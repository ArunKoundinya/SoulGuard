Inspired by the 988 website, it features a professional layout with carefully selected header and footer formatting. Colors were chosen using a color contrast analyzer to meet accessibility standards (4:1 ratio), fostering a comforting visual experience.\nThe landing page is divided into two sections: For You, focusing on personal well-being, and To Whom You Care, supporting loved ones. Custom visuals and a logo were crafted using Canva and sourced from Pixabay, ensuring an uplifting and professional design. Privacy and security are integral, with Terms and Conditions, age restrictions (18+), and user authentication required to access features like posting. This front-end design combines aesthetics and functionality to create a safe and engaging user experience.\nSharing below the templates used inside the app:\n\nHome Page:\nThis is the landing page where users are first directed, featuring two main sections: For You (focused on personal well-being) and To Whom You Care (offering support for loved ones).\n\n\n\nSign In Page:\nWhen a new user clicks on “Explore,” they will be directed to the Sign-In page.\n\nRegistration Page:\nIf the user is new, they can select the “Register” option, which will take them to the registration page to create a username and password.\n\n\n\nCreate New Post Page:\nOnce you click on explore button either for you or to whom you care it will take you to share feelings page.\n\n\n\nHappy Stage:\nWhen a post is shared, and the model predicts the stage as Happy, it reflects positive sentiment and emotional well-being in the user’s content.\n\n\n\nDepressed Stage:\nIf the model predicts a post as Depressed, the user is directed to a dedicated page with a survey form. Based on the survey responses, personalized content and resources are provided to support their mental well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\nUncertainty Stage:\nIf the model predicts a post as Confused or Seeking Clarity, the user is provided with personalized content encouraging mindfulness practices, physical activity, prioritizing rest, balanced nutrition, joining the SoulGuard community, exploring new adventures, and finding healing through nature, all aimed at promoting emotional well-being and support.\n\n\n\n\nAt Risk Stage:\nIf the model predicts a post as Suicidal or At Risk, the user is provided with tailored content, including helpline numbers, professional assistance contacts, blogs for guidance, trusted doctor details, and an option to call the 988 helpline.

The workflow includes:\n\nData Cleaning to ensure robust preprocessing of raw text data.\n\n\nWord Cloud visualization to highlight key themes from the dataset.\n\n\nTopic Analysis using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract hidden topics.\n\n\n\n\nBiLSTM Model Comparisons to evaluate deep learning performance in text classification tasks.\n\nLiME Comparisons to interpret and validate model predictions on sample sentences, enhancing trust and explainability.\n\n\nSuicide Model Update: Boosting Accuracy with Hyperparameter Tuning and Regularization\nThe Suicide Model was updated through hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance, using the best parameters identified to enhance model accuracy by 1.5%. L2 regularization was applied to mitigate overfitting, ensuring the model generalized well to new data while maintaining improved accuracy."
