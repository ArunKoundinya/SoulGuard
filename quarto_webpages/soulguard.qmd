## 1. Front-End Overview

The *SoulGuard Django Project* front-end is designed to support mental health by creating a positive and user-friendly interface. Inspired by the *988* website, it features a professional layout with carefully selected header and footer formatting. Colors were chosen using a *color contrast analyzer* to meet accessibility standards (4:1 ratio), fostering a comforting visual experience.

The landing page is divided into two sections: *For You*, focusing on personal well-being, and *To Whom You Care*, supporting loved ones. Custom visuals and a logo were crafted using Canva and sourced from Pixabay, ensuring an uplifting and professional design. Privacy and security are integral, with *Terms and Conditions*, age restrictions (18+), and user authentication required to access features like posting. This front-end design combines aesthetics and functionality to create a safe and engaging user experience.

Sharing below the templates used inside the app:

-   **Home Page:**

    This is the landing page where users are first directed, featuring two main sections: *For You* (focused on personal well-being) and *To Whom You Care* (offering support for loved ones).

**The "Share Feeling" feature leads to the recommendations section, supported by a backend framework that computes both the suicide score and the sentiment score, as detailed below.**

## 2. Back-End Models Overview

To deliver accurate and insightful results, our backend leverages advanced machine learning models and natural language processing techniques. The workflow includes:

1.  Suicide Model :

    1.  The suicide detection model is designed with three BiLSTM layers, followed by a flattening layer to process the output. This is then passed through a series of dense layers before reaching the output layer.

2.  Sentiment Model

    1.  The sentiment model is a hybrid approach combining TextBlob, VADER sentiment analysis, custom-defined words, and worry-related words derived from the NRC lexicon. The final sentiment score is calculated as a weighted average of these components.
