<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
<div class="terms-content">
    <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
    <p>Welcome to Soul Guard, a platform dedicated to providing support for mental well-being and suicide prevention. By using this app, you agree to the following Terms and Conditions, which ensure user safety, protect privacy, and outline our commitment to ethical data usage. Please read these terms carefully.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Age Requirement</strong></p>
    <p>Soul Guard is designed for users aged 18 and older. Users under 18 must have parental or guardian consent to access the app. We use reliable age verification methods to ensure compliance and safeguard younger users.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Privacy and Data Collection</strong></p>
    <p>We take your privacy seriously. We collect only minimal personal information, such as email addresses and dates of birth, which is securely encrypted and anonymized wherever possible. Users will know exactly how their data will be used, and no data will be shared with third parties without explicit consent.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Informed Consent</strong></p>
    <p>All users must provide informed consent before using the app. This ensures that users understand how their data will be used, their rights, and the scope of services Soul Guard provides. We aim to communicate this in clear, straightforward language to avoid any confusion.</p>

    <p><strong>5. Data Security and Protection</strong></p>
    <p>We use strong encryption to protect personal data and adhere to strict data security protocols to prevent unauthorized access. While we employ industry-standard security measures, we cannot fully eliminate risks associated with data breaches. In the unlikely event of a breach, we will notify affected users and take prompt action to mitigate potential harm.</p>

    <p><strong>6. Risk of Re-traumatization and Emotional Support</strong></p>
    <p>Soul Guard’s features are designed to minimize the risk of re-traumatization and to support mental health. Our questionnaire and algorithms avoid triggering content and are structured to promote positive mental health without emphasizing distressing subjects. Users may reach out to support channels available within the app should they need assistance.</p>

    <p><strong>7. Ethical Use of Data</strong></p>
    <p>Soul Guard’s algorithms and data collection methods do not discriminate based on race, gender, religion, or other protected categories. We are committed to ethical research outcomes and do not use or interpret data in ways that could harm individuals or groups.</p>

    <p><strong>8. Parental Controls for Minors</strong></p>
    <p>For users under 18, parental controls may allow parents or guardians to monitor the minor's activity, set usage limits, and access additional mental health resources tailored for young users.</p>

    <p><strong>9. Use of Third-Party Services</strong></p>
    <p>Soul Guard may integrate third-party age and identity verification services, such as ID.me, Yoti, and AgeID, to ensure compliance with age restrictions. By using the app, you agree to allow Soul Guard to use these services in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p><strong>10. Content Moderation</strong></p>
    <p>We do our best to provide supportive and non-triggering content. If users encounter material that they find distressing or inappropriate, they can report it for review. We reserve the right to modify or remove any content that violates our policies or may negatively impact mental health.</p>

    <p><strong>11. Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
    <p>Soul Guard and its team are not liable for any adverse effects that may arise from using the app, including potential mental distress. We encourage users to seek professional mental health support if they experience significant distress.</p>

    <p><strong>12. Amendments to the Terms</strong></p>
    <p>We reserve the right to update these Terms and Conditions periodically. Users will be notified of any changes, and continued use of Soul Guard after changes implies acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

    <p><strong>13. Contact and Support</strong></p>
    <p>For any questions about these Terms and Conditions or to seek support, please reach out via the contact details provided within the app.</p>
