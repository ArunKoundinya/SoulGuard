    "section": "",
    "text": "Suicides are a global crisis, with over 700,000 lives lost annually. Root causes include social isolation, financial distress, relationship struggles, and mental health disorders, with depression as a leading contributor. Depression often leaves individuals feeling hopeless and emotionally overwhelmed, and societal stigma or lack of resources prevents many from seeking help in time.\nDepression is a mental health condition marked by persistent sadness, loss of interest, and fatigue. Research including the seminal studies by Beck and colleagues, highlights a strong link between depression and suicide, as untreated depression can lead to suicidal ideation due to feelings of hopelessness. Addressing this connection is crucial to preventing tragedies.\nSoul Guard addresses this by leveraging AI to analyze social media and user input, detecting depression indicators and differentiating between general symptoms and suicide risks. With its dual-user model—“For You” and “For Whom You Care”—the app provides tailored interventions, emotional tracking, and direct access to resources, empowering users to take proactive steps and save lives."

The workflow includes:\n\nSuicide Model :\n\nThe suicide detection model is designed with three BiLSTM layers, followed by a flattening layer to process the output. This is then passed through a series of dense layers before reaching the output layer.\n\n\nSentiment Model\n\nThe sentiment model is a hybrid approach combining TextBlob, VADER sentiment analysis, custom-defined words, and worry-related words derived from the NRC lexicon. The final sentiment score is calculated as a weighted average of these components."
